## LDTS_1305 - Survivor
Survivor is a game inspired by the Survivor.io and the Realm of the Mad God games, but with a few twists. The objective of the game is to maneuver a character, the protagonist, through a series of waves of enemies coming from everywhere.

Each enemy, when killed, drops an item\coin that the player can pick up. later in the game the player will have opportunities to upgrade their weapons or craft new ones using those items\coins. The game ends when the player's health bar drops to 0.

Be aware that Survivor is an addictive game that tests the player's IQ, reflexes, instincts and patience. It's a great way to challenge yourself.
